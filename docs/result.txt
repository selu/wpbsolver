Measures:
  1. left: 1,2,3,4, right: 5,6,7,8
  2. left: 1,2,3,5, right: 4,9,10,11
  3. left: 1,4,6,9, right: 2,7,10,12
Solution:
  1 is HEAVY (HEAVY,HEAVY,HEAVY)
  1 is LIGHT (LIGHT,LIGHT,LIGHT)
  2 is HEAVY (HEAVY,HEAVY,LIGHT)
  2 is LIGHT (LIGHT,LIGHT,HEAVY)
  3 is HEAVY (HEAVY,HEAVY,EQUAL)
  3 is LIGHT (LIGHT,LIGHT,EQUAL)
  4 is HEAVY (HEAVY,LIGHT,HEAVY)
  4 is LIGHT (LIGHT,HEAVY,LIGHT)
  5 is HEAVY (LIGHT,HEAVY,EQUAL)
  5 is LIGHT (HEAVY,LIGHT,EQUAL)
  6 is HEAVY (LIGHT,EQUAL,HEAVY)
  6 is LIGHT (HEAVY,EQUAL,LIGHT)
  7 is HEAVY (LIGHT,EQUAL,LIGHT)
  7 is LIGHT (HEAVY,EQUAL,HEAVY)
  8 is HEAVY (LIGHT,EQUAL,EQUAL)
  8 is LIGHT (HEAVY,EQUAL,EQUAL)
  9 is HEAVY (EQUAL,LIGHT,HEAVY)
  9 is LIGHT (EQUAL,HEAVY,LIGHT)
  10 is HEAVY (EQUAL,LIGHT,LIGHT)
  10 is LIGHT (EQUAL,HEAVY,HEAVY)
  11 is HEAVY (EQUAL,LIGHT,EQUAL)
  11 is LIGHT (EQUAL,HEAVY,EQUAL)
  12 is HEAVY (EQUAL,EQUAL,LIGHT)
  12 is LIGHT (EQUAL,EQUAL,HEAVY)
  impossible (EQUAL,EQUAL,EQUAL)
  impossible (HEAVY,LIGHT,LIGHT)
  impossible (LIGHT,HEAVY,HEAVY)
